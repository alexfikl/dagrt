leap describes both implicit and explicit `time stepping methods
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_stepping>`_ by ways of a small virtual
machine whose instructions can then be used to either generate code or simply
execute the time integrator.

Execution and code generation for many common cases is included. Further
supported operations include finding of stability regions, building
of companion matrices, and more.

leap is under the MIT license.

leap requires Python 2.6 or newer.
